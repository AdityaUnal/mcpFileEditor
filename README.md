# File Editor
- This is a simple mcp based file editor.
- You can easily upload the folder you want to work on.
- Play with the files and folders inside.
- Follow these steps to run the application. It is better to be in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server:app
streamlit run app.py
```
